    <p>Mean is the simple mathematical average of a set of two or more numbers.</p>

    <P>A median is the middle number in a sorted list of either ascending or descending numbers. It's used in statistical studies. The numbers must first be sorted or arranged in value order from lowest to highest or highest to lowest to determine the median value in a sequence.</P>

    <P>In math, the mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. 
        Here's a more detailed explanation:
        Definition:
        The mode is the value or observation that occurs with the highest frequency in a set 
        of data. 
        Example:
        In the dataset {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4}, the mode is 3 because it appears three times, 
        which is more than any other value. 
        
        Multiple Modes:
        A dataset can have more than one mode (bimodal, trimodal, etc.) 
        if multiple values appear with the same highest frequency. 
        
        No Mode:
        If all values in a dataset appear the same number of times, there is no mode. 
        
        Usefulness:
        The mode is a measure of central tendency, along with the mean (average) and median (middle value). It's particularly useful when dealing with categorical data (data that can't be ordered numerically).
